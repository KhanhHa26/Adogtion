[Adogtion](https://adogtion.onrender.com/) is a web service designed to connect potential dog adopters with dogs in need of homes. The platform allows users to browse available dogs, post dogs for adoption, and manage the adoption process through an admin panel.

## Features
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality.
- **Browse Dogs**: Users can browse available dogs based on various filters such as location, age, and breed.
- **Post Dogs for Adoption**: Users can post dogs they want to put up for adoption.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can approve or reject dog posts, and manage the overall platform.

## Tech Stack: MERN Stack
- MongoDB: Stores data on dogs, users, and adoption statuses.
