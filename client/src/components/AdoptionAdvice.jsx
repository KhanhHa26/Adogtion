          <h3>Why we recommend adopting</h3>
          <p>
            There are so many reasons to adopt: meeting a unique pet, spending
            less, doing a good deed—but let’s talk facts. Millions of dogs enter
            shelters every year. And hundreds of thousands are euthanized each
            year. We don’t tell you that to guilt you or be a downer, but that’s
            why adoption really matters to us. So we would love it if you
            considered adopting. And, since you're here, we’re guessing you are.
            Seriously, no judgment if you find a dog another way (every dog
            parent journey is different!). But we’re here to help make adoption
            easier, however we can.

          <h3>How to find the perfect dog</h3>
          <p>
            Let’s bust a myth. The perfect dog? Doesn’t exist. Because there are
            so many dogs that can be the right fit for you. It’s just about
            knowing what you’re looking for. So start by thinking about your
            criteria based on your lifestyle, breed preferences, living
            situation, (fur and human) family, etc. From there, our team can
            help match you with the right dog.
